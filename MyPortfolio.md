About me

### **My Portfolio**
**Hi!**

My name is Daria, currently I am IT recruiter with financial background. I started learning IT when I talked to my candidates and I decided that it will be challenging to learn something in this field. Testing seems to be the most matching for me. I am very social and open-minded person. I started this  course to broaden my horizons and achieve new skills. Making all tasks during these months was unusual journey!
